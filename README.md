Abstract
--------

Notebook/UI to perform circular profile in the shape of a ring over a stack of images

This notebook will allows you to load a set of files (all tiff or fits images from a given folder) and will
bring a user interface to allow you to define a ring. The circular profile will then be calculated along the
ring and integrated over the thickness of the ring, on all the images loaded.

The output will be an ASCII file with the average counts over the thickness of the ring versus the
angle position, for each of the images loaded.
