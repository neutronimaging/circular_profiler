# circular_profiler
Notebook/UI to perform circular profile in the shape of a ring over a stack of images

This notebook will allows you to load a set of files (all tiff or fits images from a given folder) and will
bring a user interface to allow you to define a ring. The circular profile will then be calculated along the
ring and integrated over the thickness of the ring, on all the images loaded.
